description: Audoux's first novel is the most autobiographical of the four. She describes
  her childhood and adolescence, inculding the story of her mother's death, her father's
  departure, and the nine years she spent in the orphanage of the convent Hôpital
  Général de Bourges. The second part of the novel takes place on the farm in Villevielle
  where Marie-Claire's first employers Master Sylvain and Pauline surround the young
  shepardess with good-hearted affection. In the third part, Marie-Claire, now a young
  woman, falls in love with Henri Deslois, the brother of the farmer's wife who followed
  Pauline. The young man's mother forbids Marie-Claire to see her son again. Marie-Claire
  returns to the convent before leaving for Paris.
